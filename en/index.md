## Safety Guidelines

Safety is paramount in RC flying, protecting both pilots and others:

### Pre-Flight Checklist

Ensure your aircraft is flight-ready:
1. Inspect Structure: Check for cracks, loose screws, and secure landing gear.
2. Control Surfaces: Verify correct movement (e.g., stick right = right aileron up).
3. Battery: Confirm full charge, secure mounting, and no damage.
4. Radio: Test range (30m minimum) and failsafe settings.
5. Environment: Check wind speed, visibility, and clear airspace.
6. Set failsafe to cut power if the signal is lost.

### Flight Techniques

- **Basic Flight Principles**: Learn the essentials before takeoff: Controls (throttle, elevator, aileron, rudder), Wind Awareness (take off and land into the wind), Flight Patterns (practice figure-eights and rectangular circuits), Avoid Mistakes (don’t overcorrect controls or fly too low too soon).
- **Takeoff**: Gradually increase throttle, use rudder to track straight, and lift off smoothly.
- **Landing**: Maintain steady speed, keep wings level, and flare gently before touchdown.
- **Crosswinds**: Use the wing-low method and crab into the wind for control.
- **Emergencies**: Power Loss (glide to a safe landing area), Signal Loss (rely on failsafe), Structural Issue (reduce speed and land carefully).

### Weather Considerations

- **Wind**: Beginners should fly in calm conditions (0–3 m/s), while experienced pilots can handle 3–8 m/s. Avoid winds over 8 m/s or gusty conditions. At Talosaari, southeast/northwest winds are best, while southwest/west winds may cause turbulence near the forest.
- **Rain**: Avoid flying in rain unless your aircraft is designed for it, as moisture can damage electronics and weaken wood or foam structures.
- **Temperature**: Cold weather reduces battery performance, so keep batteries warm before flight. In hot weather, monitor electronics for overheating.
- **Visibility**: Avoid fog or low light for clear line of sight.
Check forecasts at yr.no before heading out, ensuring conditions are suitable for your skill level.

**Pro Tip**: Always fly with a spotter for extra safety and awareness.

### Safety at the Field

- **Personal Safety**: Avoid contact with propellers and rotors. Handle LiPo batteries carefully, using a safety bag for charging, and recycle damaged batteries. Protect yourself from the sun and stay hydrated.
- **Aircraft Safety**: Program failsafe settings, keep within visual range and a safe distance from people, and adhere to permitted flight altitudes (usually maximum 120 meters).
- **Emergencies**: If you lose control, shout a warning. In case of a crash, first ensure no one is injured, then check for damage.
